# Hack Cambridge 2022

We made use of the dlib Facial Landmark Detector, available under the Boost Software License from https://github.com/davisking/dlib. 
The pretrained weights used are available from http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2 and the downloaded file should be 
stored in <code>/backend/dlib_shape_predictor</code>
